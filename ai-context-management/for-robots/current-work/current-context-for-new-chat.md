# Current Context for New Chat

## Status
- `legacy/` contains an older React/FastAPI/Docker scaffold plus a detailed planning doc, but the frontend UI was not implemented (no `src/` in `legacy/frontend/`).
- A new static homepage mockup exists at `mockups/homepage.html` for quick layout critique (no build tooling required).

## Current Decisions
- Homepage project tiles should include: thumbnail + Live instance + Video demo + GitHub repo actions.
- Final framework/stack is intentionally undecided until the mockup is approved.

## Next Questions
- What should the homepage prioritize: projects-first, writing-first, or narrative-first?
- Do we want a single-page scroll, or separate pages for Projects / Writing / About?
