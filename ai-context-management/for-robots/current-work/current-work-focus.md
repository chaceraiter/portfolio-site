# Current Work Focus

This is a new portfolio-site repo using an AI context system. A legacy repo was imported to `legacy/` for reference, but the actual portfolio implementation is intentionally being rebuilt. The immediate focus is creating a static homepage mockup that nails layout and project presentation (thumbnail tiles with Live / Video Demo / GitHub actions) before choosing a final framework and building the production site.

- **Project Goal:** A polished, fast personal portfolio that communicates credibility quickly and makes it easy to view projects, demos, and contact info.

- **Intermediate Goal:** Agree on the homepage information architecture and visual direction using a static mockup.

- **Current Task:** Produce and iterate on a static homepage mockup (projects grid with thumbnail tiles + Live/Video/GitHub actions).
