# Current Work Focus

This is a new portfolio-site repo using an AI context system. A legacy repo was imported to `legacy/` for reference, but the actual portfolio implementation is intentionally being rebuilt. The current direction is a “persistent shell” one-page experience: the header and right rail stay consistent while the main content switches views (Projects / Resume / Blog / Contact) via hash navigation.

- **Project Goal:** A polished, fast personal portfolio that communicates credibility quickly and makes it easy to view projects, demos, and contact info.

- **Intermediate Goal:** Lock in the persistent-shell layout, the view-switching interaction, and the content model for projects/resume/blog/contact.

- **Current Task:** Refine the `mockups/homepage.html` tabbed views, polish the header/hero, and fill in real content safely (resume, headshot, social links, and contact approach).
