# Project Vision and Goals

## Vision
Build a clean, fast, and professional personal portfolio site that showcases projects and writing, provides clear ways to contact me, and supports linking/embedding live demos.

## Why
- Present my work in a way that’s easy for recruiters/clients/collaborators to understand quickly.
- Centralize links (projects, GitHub, blog, resume, contact) in a cohesive experience.
- Keep the site maintainable so updates are easy and frequent.

## Target Audience
- Recruiters and hiring managers evaluating fit and credibility.
- Potential clients/collaborators evaluating capabilities and past work.
- Other engineers browsing projects/demos.

## Product Goals
- Project showcase that highlights impact and technical depth (links to code and demos).
- Optional blog integration (link out or mirror) to show writing/thinking.
- Contact path that’s obvious and low-friction.
- Responsive design with dark/light mode support.
- Strong baseline quality: performance, accessibility, and SEO.

## Core Sections (Expected)
- Hero: name/title, short intro, key links, prominent resume download/link.
- Projects: grid/list with tech tags, thumbnail, and clear actions per project (Live, Video Demo, GitHub), plus optional filtering/search.
- Writing/Blog: link to external blog and/or show recent posts.
- Contact: form (optional) + direct email + social links.

## Non-Goals (For Now)
- Heavy CMS or complex admin tooling unless it clearly pays off.
- Over-engineered backend/database requirements unless needed for contact/blog mirroring.

## Success Criteria
- Loads quickly (mobile-first), feels polished, and is easy to navigate.
- Accessibility baseline (keyboard-friendly, semantic structure, contrast).
- Easy to update content (projects, links, copy) without high overhead.
